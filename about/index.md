I am an independent security researcher with keen interest in web application securiy, programming, OSINT, GeoINT and social engineering.<br>
Basically, I make things, I break things and I make things that break things.

On the programming side, I am a hyperactive open source contributor.
Some of my projects are:
- [Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon): Incredibly fast crawler designed for OSINT
- [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike): Most advanced XSS detection suite
- [Recon Dog](https://github.com/s0md3v/ReconDog): Reconnaissance Swiss Army Knife

You can find others at [my Github profile](https://github.com/s0md3v).
