I am a hacker who likes programming. Basically, I make things, I break things and I make things that break things.
Apart from that, I have keen interest in OSINT, GeoINT and all that fun intelligence stuff.
I like to write ReDOS exploits and bypass WAFs in my free time. One of the things I love is to use concepts of entropy, statistics and probablity in what I do.

Oh well, I am a hyperactive open source contributor.
Some of my projects are:
- [Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon): Incredibly fast crawler designed for OSINT
- [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike): Most advanced XSS detection suite
- [Recon Dog](https://github.com/s0md3v/ReconDog): Reconnaissance Swiss Army Knife

You can find others at [my Github profile](https://github.com/s0md3v).
